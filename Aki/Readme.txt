There are two types of annotations.
First is named as LeftPawManual_XXXXX. XXXXXX is the avi file name.
I labeled  left paw side view and from the mirror for ~ 10 trial for each avi file. 

The other is named as the same as the .avi files. 
In those files, Maddy did manual error detection. You will find a vector with ones labeling the frame number when the animals' front two paws (either one of them) are off the bar (missteps).
